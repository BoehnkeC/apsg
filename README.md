Download and install APSG module
--------------------------------

APSG is distributed as a single file with no traditional python install implemented yet. For now, download `apsg.py` file and save it to working directory or to any folder on `PYTHONPATH`.

First steps with APSG module
============================

APSG defines several new python classes to easily manage, analyze and visualize orientational structural geology data. Base class `Vec3` is derived from `numpy.array` class and affers several new method which will be explained on following examples.

Import APSG module
------------------

APSG module could be imported either into own namespace or into active one for easier interactive work:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> from apsg import *
~~~~

Basic operation with vectors
----------------------------

Instance of vector object `Vec3` could be created from any iterable object as list, tuple or array:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> u = Vec3([1, -2, 3])
>>> v = Vec3([-2, 1, 1])
~~~~

For common vector operation we can use standard mathematical operators or special methods using dot notation:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> u+v
V(-1.000, -1.000, 4.000)
>>> u-v
V(3.000, -3.000, 2.000)
>>> 3*u-2*v
V(7.000, -8.000, 7.000)
~~~~

Its magnitude or length is most commonly defined as its Euclidean norm and could be calculated using `abs`:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> abs(v)
2.4494897427831779
>>> abs(u)
3.7416573867739413
>>> abs(2*u)
7.4833147735478827
~~~~

For *dot product* we can use multiplification operator `*` or `dot` method:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> u*v
-1
>>> u.dot(v)
-1
~~~~

For *cross product* we can use operator `**` or method `cross`:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> u**v
V(-5.000, -7.000, -3.000)
>>> u.cross(v)
V(-5.000, -7.000, -3.000)
~~~~

To project vector \(\vec{u}\) onto vector \(\vec{v}\) we can use method `proj`:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> u.proj(v)
V(0.333, -0.167, -0.167)
~~~~

To find angle (in degrees) between to vectors we use method `angle`:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> u.angle(v)
96.263952719927218
~~~~

Method `rotate` provide possibility to rotate vector around another vector. For example, to rotate vector \(\vec{u}\) around vector \(\vec{v}\) for 45Â°:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> u.rotate(v,45)
V(2.248, 0.558, 2.939)
~~~~

Classes Fol a Lin
=================

To work with orientational data in structural geology, APSG provide two classes derived from `Vec3` class. There is `Fol` class to represent planar features by planes and `Lin` class to represent linear feature by lines. Both classes provide all `Vec3` methods, but they differ in way how instance is created and how some operations are calculated, as structural geology data are commonly axial in nature. The special class `Pole` is derived from `Fol` and only differs in way how it is visualized on stereographic projection.

To create instance of `Fol` or `Lin` class, we have to provide dip direction and dip, both in degrees:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> Lin(120,60)
L:120/60
>>> Fol(216,62)
S:216/62
>>> Pole(216,62)
P:216/62
~~~~

or we can create instance from `Vec3` object:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> u.aslin()
L:297/53
>>> u.asfol()
S:117/37
>>> u.aspole()
P:117/37
~~~~

Vec3 methods for Fol a Lin
--------------------------

To find angle between two linear or planar features:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> l1 = Lin(110,40)
>>> l2 = Lin(160,30)
>>> l1.angle(l2)
41.597412680035468
>>> p1 = Fol(330,50)
>>> p2 = Fol(250,40)
>>> p1.angle(p2)
54.696399321975328
~~~~

To construct planar feature defined by two linear features:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> l1**l2
S:113/40
~~~~

To construct linear feature defined as intersection of two planar features:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> p1**p2
L:278/36
~~~~

**Cross product** of planar and linear features could be used to:

-   construct plane defined by linear feature and normal of planar feature:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> l2**p2
S:96/53
~~~~

-   or to find perpendicular linear feature on given plane.

~~~~ {.python}
>>> p2**l2
L:276/37
~~~~

Combined **cross product** could be used to find perpendicular projection of linear feature onto planar one, or project planar feature to pass trough linear feature:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> p2**l2**p2
L:176/13
>>> l2**p2**l2
S:223/52
~~~~

To rotate structural features we can use method `rotate`:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> p2.rotate(l2,45)
S:269/78
~~~~

Dataset class
=============

`Dataset` class serve as list or container of `Fol` or `Lin` objects. It allows grouping of features either for visualization or batch analysis.

~~~~ {.python}
>>> d = Dataset(name='Test data')
>>> for dd in [Lin(120,60), Lin(116,50), Lin(132,45), Fol(90,60), Fol(84,52
)]:
...     d.append(dd)
... 
>>> print(d)
Test data:[L:120/60, L:116/50, L:132/45, S:90/60, S:84/52]
~~~~

Same dataset could be created in simple way as:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> d = Dataset([ Lin(120,60), Lin(116,50), Lin(132,45),
...               Fol(90,60), Fol(84,52) ], name='Test data')
... 
>>> print(d)
Test data:[L:120/60, L:116/50, L:132/45, S:90/60, S:84/52]
~~~~

Method `len` returns number of features in dataset:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> len(d)
5
~~~~

To select only linear or planar features we can use methods `getlins` a `getfols`. Properties `numlin` a `numfol` gives number of linear or planar features in dataset.

~~~~ {.python}
>>> d.getlins()
Test data:[L:120/60, L:116/50, L:132/45]
>>> d.numlins
3
>>> d.getfols()
Test data:[S:90/60, S:84/52]
>>> d.numfols
2
~~~~

Another property of dataset is `resultant`,which returns mean or resultant of all features in dataset:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> d.getlins().resultant
L:123/52
>>> d.getfols().resultant
S:87/56
~~~~

To measure angles between all features in dataset and another feature, we can use method `angle`:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> d = Dataset([Lin(120,60), Lin(116,50), Lin(132,45), Lin(95,52)])
>>> d.angle(d.resultant)
array([  7.74624256,   2.54411184,  12.80183755,  12.94898331])
~~~~

To rotate all features in dataset around another feature, we can use method `rotate`:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> d.rotate(l1, 45)
R-Default:[L:90/57, L:103/50, L:120/55, L:89/41]
~~~~

Schmidt projection
==================

Any `Fol`, `Lin`, `Pole`, `Vec3' or`Dataset\` object could be visualized in Schmidt projection:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> SchmidtNet(Fol(214,55), Lin(120,60), Pole(240,60), Vec3([-1,-2,1]))
<apsg.SchmidtNet object at 0x7f45e14710d0>
~~~~

![](figures/apsg_figure26_1.png)

Features could be added to Schmidt projection programatically as well:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> s = SchmidtNet()
>>> s.add(Fol(150,40))
>>> s.add(Pole(150,40))
>>> s.add(Lin(112,30))
>>> s.show()
~~~~

![](figures/apsg_figure27_1.png)

`Dataset` properties as color and name are used during visualization:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> s.clear()
>>> d = Dataset([Lin(120,60), Lin(116,50), Lin(132,45), Lin(95,52)], name='
Test', color='red')
>>> s.add(d)
>>> s.show()
~~~~

![](figures/apsg_figure28_1.png)

All mentioned classes could be freely combined:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> s.clear()
>>> d = Dataset([ Lin(120,70), Lin(116,42), Lin(132,45), Lin(95,52) ], colo
r='green')
>>> s.add(d)
>>> s.add(d.resultant)
>>> s.show()
~~~~
